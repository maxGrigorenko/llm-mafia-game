=== YOUR CURRENT ASSESSMENTS ===
{graph_state}{bigfive_section}{night_outcome_section}

=== TASK ===
Based on the discussion, update your assessment of these players: {', '.join(players_to_evaluate)}

For each player, evaluate:
1. **mafia_probability**: How likely they are Mafia (0.0 = definitely innocent, 1.0 = definitely Mafia)
2. **trust**: Your trust in them (-1.0 = complete distrust, 0.0 = neutral, 1.0 = complete trust)

Also note any trust/distrust you observed BETWEEN other players.

Consider:
- Who accused whom and how convincingly?
- Who defended whom?
- Voting patterns and flip-flopping
- Emotional reactions vs logical arguments
- Who tries to lead vs who stays quiet?
- (If Big Five estimates are available) how consistent a player's traits are with a typical Mafia or innocent profile.
